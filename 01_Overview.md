# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) on Raspberry Pi 5

This project documents my process setting up a lightweight Network Intrusion Detection System using Suricata on a Raspberry Pi 5 running Kali Linux. The goal is to monitor network traffic, identify suspicious behavior, and build a foundation for hands-on cybersecurity learning.

I used the Raspberry Pi as a 24/7 monitoring device for my home network. All testing, configuration, and logging were done through SSH or local access to the Pi.

The project is broken into phases:

- Phase 1: Environment setup and Suricata installation
- Phase 2: Basic logging, alert generation, and log monitoring
- Phase 3: Traffic simulation and deeper rule customization (next)
- Phase 4: Future plans including remote alerting, dashboards, and alert tuning
